			<! -- item 2, letter b, item iii completed with a paragraph explaining what
				  I will do over Spring Break -->
			<p>During <strong>Spring</strong> Break <ins>this</ins> year, I will <em>finalize</em> a game I have been <br />
			   preparing for competition in May. The concept of the game revolves <br />
			   around a lone prisoner who wakes to discover a planet torn between two <br /> 
			   different factions: the Light and Dark armies. Over the course of the <br />
			   adventure, the player will decide which faction presents the more noble <br />
			   cause and thus is worthy of his or her support. The game additionally <br />
			   includes branching pathways that result from the player's decisions. <br />
			   Production is currently in its final steps and will hopefully conclude <br />
			   by the competition date. CaSO<sub>4</sub> is my favorite <del>element</del> chemical formula. <br />
               ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 is my favorite equation.
