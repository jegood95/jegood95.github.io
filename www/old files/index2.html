           <p>
              My name is <strong>Joshua Good</strong> and I am a sophomore Computer Science major concentrating in <ins>Game Design studies</ins>. <br />
              While many would regard Game Design as simply the action of building a game, the true study of user <br />
              - system interaction extends far beyond the <em>traditional</em> elements of simple play. The art of Game Design <br />
              entails a deeper understanding of the complex systems that occur during the user's surface - level interaction <br />
              with game objects. Level design, audio engineering, programming simulations, and artificial intelligence/enemy <br />
              behaviors present different challenges that determine the atmosphere and function of a game. To a game designer, <br />
              the manner in which these elements appear to the player portrays the genre or play-style the player will experience <br />
              during gameplay. For example, traditional role playing game (RPG) mechanics center around the player's assumption <br />
              of a character that he or she must progress over the course of the adventure. Here, an effective environment must <br />
              encourage the player to explore and discover new locations, creating an immersive and believable world.

           <p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; color: #00008A; text-align: center;">
              Expanding on my major, my favorite hobby is creating games. No matter the genre, games present a fascinating challenge <br />
              to solving multi-variable problems in addition to general player entertainment. While the core goal of a traditional game <br />
              tasks a design team to develop an entertaining and engaging experience, the method in which this goal is achieved depends <br />
              upon the game's intended direction. In my case, for programmers, this challenge becomes especially relevant as their job <br />
              consists of implementing different systems into the game environment while ensuring their intended functions. For instance, <br />
              if a design team wishes to immerse the player in an underwater environment, programmers must consider the movement of the <br />
              character, the interaction between the player character and randomly-encountered life, and the consideration of an oxygen <br />
              oxygen system if relevant to the design of the game. However, while I mostly develop traditional games, I have also developed <br />
              serious games, or games that teach a real-world concept to the player. When developing serious games, while creating educational <br />
              content can be entertaining, the greatest enjoyment comes with the satisfaction of students and other players saying that they learned <br />
              something new and want to see future content.

           <p>
              While I owned two cats for the majority of my life, I adopted my first dog when I was twelve. Originally, I had been adverse <br />
              to getting another pet as the thought of my aggressive cats attempting to wrestle with a "new contender" would be disastrous. <br />
              Unfortunately, my parents had the final decision in the matter and proceeded with the adoption. However, as I grew up with my dog <br />
              throughout my junior high and high school years, I grew close to her and gained the admiration my parent's had for her the day they <br />
              brought her home. A dog acts like no other pet; it is the companion that will never desert you and the friend that is always there to <br />
              comfort you. It shares in your experiences and leaps with excitement in the presence of its owner. While some individuals may find the <br />
              maintenance associated with grooming and feeding to be a chore, it is these very activities that promote beneficial character traits <br />
              and etiquette techniques that will aid in the pursuit of self-betterment. While my cats will always be my first companions, my dog will <br />
              will always be a member of the family.
